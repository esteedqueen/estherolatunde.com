> _What hardware I use?_
>
> I use a pretty simple and old MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) for my day to day programming. I also have an HP Pavillon 15-inch with Linux Ubuntu OS as my secondary laptop, 2 1TB hard drives and a Google Home device
>
> _What software do I use?_
>
> For development, I use a mix of Sublime Text, iTerm, Bash, Tmux and Vim. I recently download VS Code to check out what the hype was about but it didn't stick (probably because I was lazy to try something new). For mobile development, I use the Android Studio and XCode IDEs.
>
> I use Things as a personal todo/schedule/life management tool. Spotify for music, iTunes for podcasts, Headspace for meditation, and Trello, Slack, GitHub, GSuite as work tools. Honourable mention goes to Google Calendar - almost every hour of my week is planned on my GCal synced between 3 email accounts.
>
> I like using Postman for testing APIs and I prefer using Zeplin for receiving designs from UI designers. I have 4 browsers installed (Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Safari). Until recently, I often use Chrome as default, Firefox and Safari for testing web pages but I'm recently adopting Brave as my default browser. I'd really appreciate a simple, easy to access tool that helps you test for other browsers (Edge, IE, etc.). I recently had to make a Vue/Foundation website work on IE 13 and my experience testing on a remote platform such as BrowserStack wasn't so great.
>
> As a remote company, we've also recently adopted Zoom for our voice and video calls as Slack breaks down with more than 3 - 4 people on a call.
>
> I recently uninstalled Cold Turkey and started using the Focus app for keeping my Twitter addiction at bay and I'm loving the experience so far.
>
> _What would be my dream setup?_
>
> My dream setup would involve replacing my 2 laptops with newer models and bigger screens. I'd also like to have a noise-cancelling headset and a standalone display (for when I become less nomadic). For software, I'd love a more intuitive integration of Things and Google Calendar.
