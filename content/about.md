Hi, I’m Esther Olatunde - a software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria.

I’m currently a Full Stack Software Developer at [Lexoo].

Prior to that, I co-founded [Tress](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tress) (YC W2017) as the CTO and worked as a Senior Developer at a [software consultancy firm](https://www.happybearsoftware.com) building products for businesses in the UK.

One of the reasons why I love programming is that I learn new things everyday. It can get a bit crazy but I absolutely love it. I’ve tried keeping records in private gists but that has gotten a bit scattered and sharing is always a good thing :)

This blog is an attempt at documenting my thoughts, learnings and journey in a semi-formal / semi-consistent form.

A few more random tidbits about me: I’m a newbie yogi, I think I change my hairstyles way too often, I've read and I own all the books in the Harry Potter series, I recently built a [simple http web server](https://github.com/esteedqueen/simple-http-server) from scratch with Ruby, I trained a simple ML classifier that identifies different types of hairstyles ;) using Tensorflow, I’m currently building [MuteEveryone.com](https://twitter.com/muteeveryone) and learning about the Ruby internals.
