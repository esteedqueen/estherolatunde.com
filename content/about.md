Hi, I’m Esther Olatunde - a fullstack software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria.

I co-founded [Tress](https://www.tressapp.co/) (YC W2017) as the CTO/Engineering Lead.

I’m currently a Senior Developer at [Happy Bear Software](https://www.happybearsoftware.com/) helping businesses build, maintain and secure custom web applications.

One of the reasons why I love what I do is that I learn new things everyday. It’s a bit crazy and I love it. I’ve tried keeping records in private gists but that has gotten a bit scattered and sharing is always a good thing :)

This blog is an attempt at documenting my thoughts, learnings and journey in a semi-formal / semi-consistent form.
